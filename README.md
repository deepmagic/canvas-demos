# canvas-demos

This is a handful of demos I wrote for [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/deepmagic) using the 2d canvas context.

It includes one extra demo [dancer](https://deepmagic.github.io/canvas-demos/dancer) that never made it on to that site due to security restrictions with how videos are handled.
I was experimenting with 2d kernel operations for this demo which resulted in a small library, [pxmute.js](https://github.com/deepmagic/canvas-demos/blob/master/js/pxmute.js).
